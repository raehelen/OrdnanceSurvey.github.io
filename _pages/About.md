# Why use GitHub?

Our aim is to provide mapping that informs, guides and inspires. Our vision is to reveal our ever-changing landscape in extraordinary detail, giving the most comprehensive view of Britain. 

Therefore we will use Github as a knowledge share tool to improve the usability and discoverability of OS data. Github provides not only access to code, tools, documentation, etc. but also a route which you can use to feedback and collaborate with our technical teams.

# What will I find on this GitHub page?

Our Github page is designed to allow you to easily navigate to our product repositories and associated tools, schema's, stylesheets etc.

<br>

<details>
 <summary><b>How can we find OS product repositories?</b></summary>
<br>
The <a href="https://raehelen.github.io/test-page/">Repositories</a> page provides quick access to a GitHub repository for each of the main OS Data Products.
<br>
<br>
The <a href="https://raehelen.github.io/test-page/tools/">Tools</a> page provides more general tools, resources and code we have available to help you get started with our geospatial data.

 <summary><b>How do I download or clone a repository?</b></summary>
<br>
 <ol>

 <li>Click <b>Download</b>to download a zip file.</li>
 <li>Or in the <b>Clone</b> with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repostory.</li>
</ol>
 When you clone a repository, it creates a local copy on your computer and can be synced between two locations using Git. 
 <br>
 <br>
 When you download a repository, you are downloading all the source files without any of the files in the .git folder.  
 <br>
 <br>
 Only cloning will enable you to have a functional git repository and run git commands with a copy of the full history. If you clone a    repository you are not modifying the original repository, all edits and commits are done locally. If you want to submit changes to the  original, you will have to make a pull request.
