# Why Use Ordnance Survey's GitHub?

Github provides a primary route for technical support and engagement with OS, providing not only access to code, tools, documentation, etc. but also a route which you can use to feedback and collaborate with our technical teams. 

We will use this as a route to a knowledge share tool improving the usability and discoverability of OS data.
