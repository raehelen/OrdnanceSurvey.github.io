# Why Use Ordnance Survey's GitHub?

Github provides a primary route for technical support and engagement with OS, providing not only access to code, tools, documentation, etc but also a route which you can use to feedback and collaborate with our technical teams. 

We will use this as a route to a knowledge share tool improving the usability and discoverability of OS data.
<br>

# What will I find on this GitHub page?

Our Github page is designed to allow you to easily navigate to our product repositories and associated schemas, SQL, stylesheets etc.

From the [Products](https://raehelen.github.io/test-page/products/) page you will find links to each product repository. Each product repository is then organised into folders & sub-folders so you can easily locate the product resource you are looking for.
